  <p>This is a living document. The list will be updated accordingly as I have new ideas that stick around for a while and, much more infrequently, as I actually do anything on this list. Currently the list stands at 8 to do and 2&nbsp;done.</p>
<p>Each item inherits standard acceptance criteria. For something to be checked off, I have to ship something, whatever shipping means (literally deploying, merging a <span class="caps">PR</span>, solving some problem). If I have help doing something, for example, I write a mobile app at a hackathon with my friends and deploy it, that still counts. The items are in no particular&nbsp;order.</p>
<h3>//&nbsp;ToDo</h3>
<h4>Deploy a mobile&nbsp;app</h4>
<p>This one is really straightforward: write an app (probably in Flutter or Swift) and have it accepted on a store (App Store and/or Play Store, depending on the application). I have taken one semester of mobile development, which was taught in Kotlin, and I took a student-lead informal class on Swift my first year, but otherwise I have very little experience with native apps. Mobile development offers opportunities and challenges missing from web development: offline operation, system resources, and the device&nbsp;APIs.</p>
<h4>Write a programming&nbsp;book</h4>
<p>I <a href="https://philipkiely.com/essays/posts.html">write programming tutorials</a> and other technical content (I strive for those <span class="caps">README</span>.md style points). I harbor ambitions of writing a full-length programming book, probably in Django but maybe about something else, as there are already a lot of really good Django books. I have a couple of outlines but nothing sizable completed, but as I develop my skills in both writing and programming the project will come within&nbsp;reach.</p>
<h4>Build a <span class="caps">PC</span></h4>
<p>Building a <span class="caps">PC</span> is not super complicated; it’s basically six parts: a <span class="caps">CPU</span>, a motherboard, <span class="caps">RAM</span>, a <span class="caps">GPU</span>, a boot drive, and a power supply. Then add cooling and a case. It can get much more complex from there, especially when systems like water cooling come into the equation, but it is a very doable process. I&#8217;ve watched enough Linus Tech Tips to feel pretty confident that I can complete a standard&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>I love the MacOS operating system, and I prefer to develop on Apple products. I have used a variety of windows 7 laptops at jobs, and I can confidently say that a Windows <span class="caps">PC</span> results in a serious decrease in development quality of life for me. However, Windows 10 seems to be a very capable operating system for a variety of tasks. Of course, any <span class="caps">PC</span> I would build would have two boot drives: one for Windows 10 and one for&nbsp;Linux.</p>
<h4>Bug&nbsp;Bounty</h4>
<p>A bug bounty program is a channel for responsibly reporting vulnerabilities in software. Google runs the largest individual program, and their rewards for serious vulnerabilities go up to five figures. <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com">Bugcrowd</a> is a website that organizes a large number of smaller bounties, offering a unified platform for reporting. Other companies maintain their own programs, both public and&nbsp;unofficial.</p>
<p>Discovering and exploiting a bug takes serious knowledge. You have to know common vulnerabilities and where they might manifest, and then poke the code until something breaks in a meaningful way. While I don’t have deep security knowledge, I have taken a couple of classes in the subject. I have written a bunch of web apps; then patched my own security bugs. I know the basics of where to look. The great thing about bug bounties is that new software gets written every day, and a non-zero amount of it is broken in interesting ways. All I need to do is find&nbsp;it.</p>
<h4>Contribute to a piece of <span class="caps">OSS</span> that I use&nbsp;regularly</h4>
<p>I wrote about my first experience with improving an open source tool <a href="https://philipkiely.com/essays/first-open-source.html">here</a>. However, that was a fairly minor improvement with a major structural change, so I did not attempt a pull request to integrate my changes back into the main repository because the result was so different from the&nbsp;original.</p>
<p>Arbitrarily outlining criteria for this project, I would classify success as the acceptance of a pull request to the master branch of an active project with 1000 or more stars on GitHub where the pull request contains a new feature, extension, documentation, or non-trivial bug&nbsp;fix.</p>
<h4>Go&nbsp;Low</h4>
<p>This category is incredibly vague. Most stuff I&#8217;ve developed is pretty standard and high level: <span class="caps">CRUD</span> web apps, responsive pages, and Python implementations of standard algorithms. While I&#8217;m not a researcher or an embedded developer (usually, if physics is something I have to think about while programming, I&#8217;ve gone too low), I strive to one day write something substantial in a language where I do my own memory management. Thanks to <span class="caps">CS</span> 213 (operating systems), I have the foundation to do this, all I need is something that I want to work on where using C is the best (meaning probably the only)&nbsp;option.</p>
<h4>Serious&nbsp;Automation</h4>
<p>I listen to <a href="https://www.relay.fm">podcasts</a> about automation, power user features, and new releases while I commute. I write most of my code in scripting languages and I use Terminal.app an appropriate amount for a programmer. Despite this, I have very few real automations that I made myself (although this blog has required a few new ones). While of course I harbor fantasies of creating <span class="caps">J.A.R.V.I.S.</span>(voiced by Paul Bettany), I think Apple and Amazon might beat me there. However, I think I can get to the point where the entirety of my keyboard falls under &#8220;don&#8217;t touch that, you don&#8217;t know what it does.&#8221; Or, I&#8217;ll just get into iOS shortcuts, who knows. I&#8217;m particularly interested in automation for email and other communication, work and productivity enhancement, and daily logistics. This description is pretty vague, so I&#8217;ll say the acceptance criteria is having enough personal automations written to keep an <span class="caps">EC2</span> instance or a Mac Mini sitting in the corner fairly&nbsp;busy.</p>
<h3>Make a&nbsp;game</h3>
<p>I rarely play video games, mostly I play Kart or Smash socially at school or in the conference room after work. I&#8217;m really bad at video games, mostly because I don&#8217;t play often, but partially because most video games require an impossible-for-me controller grip (actually alleviated for Kart and Smash by a classic gamecube controller). I am also aware of the difficult economics of the video game industry and the incredible odds against even a moderately successful independent video game project. None of that stops me from the cliché software developer reaction of looking at a simple or even complicated game and saying &#8220;I should make something like that.&#8221; Whatever. That&#8217;s what bucket lists and hackathons are&nbsp;for.</p>
<h3>git commit -m&nbsp;&#8220;Done&#8221;</h3>
<h4>Win a prize at a&nbsp;hackathon</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to four hackathons (really, two hackathons twice each). HackISU in spring 2017 was a turning point in my interest in computer science. Then, Hack UIowa fall 2017 was the first time that I won something, and the same event led to my first development job. I&#8217;ve been back to each since, and won two more category prizes at Hack&nbsp;UIowa.</p>
<p>A fair extension to this entry is to attend a Hackathon out of state, and another is to place in the top three rather than winning a category prize. This is why lists like these are never&nbsp;finished.</p>
<p><a href="https://philipkiely.com/essays/hackathon.html">More on hackathons here</a>.</p>
<h4>Deploy a website on a cloud hosting&nbsp;platform</h4>
<p><a href="https://grammiegram.com">GrammieGram</a> was the first. It started on Digital Ocean and I changed it over to <span class="caps">AWS</span>. I&#8217;ve done a few others on <span class="caps">AWS</span> since then. Every time I deploy a website on <span class="caps">AWS</span>, I use Elastic Beanstalk to make sure everything is in place and communicating nicely, but recently I&#8217;ve branched out to using <span class="caps">AWS</span> Lambda and related services as&nbsp;well.</p>&#8718;
