  <h1>Applied Personal Finance for Independent&nbsp;Creators</h1>
  <code class="post-info">| First Posted <b>13 June 2019</b> | Last Edited <b>13 June 2019</b> | Philip Kiely |</code>
  <hr/>
  <p>Many people on the internet want to tell you what to do with your money. Spend. Save. Invest. These articles often offer conflicting advice, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that most of them are wrong. Rather, as with any system, a financial system must be built with a goal, and different goals will result in very different systems. The goal of my system is building a stable, robust financial engine that supports independence in my life and&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>I should offer two disclaimers at the onset. First off, this will be a long article. Second, this is close enough to the sort of advice that people get paid for giving that I should say that I&#8217;m not a lawyer, accountant, financial advisor, or in any other way officially licensed to talk about this stuff. Nothing in this article constitutes investment advice, tax advice, or legal advice. Just because this works for me does not mean that it will be right for you, I encourage you to modify the system to meet your lifestyle and&nbsp;goals.</p>
<p>A sprinkle of early-retirement saving, corporate finance, personal finance best practices, and the following&nbsp;assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a small business, creative practice, or consulting operation that you make or intend to make your living&nbsp;from.</li>
<li>You are making enough money from that or other sources to pay your living expenses, or you have enough savings to cover the period that you intend to go without income while building&nbsp;something.</li>
<li>Certain taxation and investment assumptions are based only on my experience as an American, and may not be the same for all Americans and will almost certainly be different for citizens of other&nbsp;countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>My system makes it easy to answer the&nbsp;questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I afford to buy this&nbsp;car/computer/vacation?</li>
<li>If I stopped making income today, how long before I run out of money without changing my lifestyle? What lifestyle changes would extend that period the&nbsp;most?</li>
<li>In the long term, am I increasing my net worth and saving for&nbsp;retirement?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">IMAGE</span>: Chart of&nbsp;Accounts</p>
<p>A personal finance system has two components: accounts (where the money lives) and an accounting system (how you keep track of the money). There are four categories, or levels, of accounts in personal finance: Cash, Operations, Funds, and Wealth. The accounting system can run on anything, from a spreadsheet to dedicated software like Quickbooks. Different levels have different tracking standards, and transers between levels are always recorded in the accounting&nbsp;system.</p>
<p><span class="caps">IMAGE</span>: Cash inputs and&nbsp;outputs</p>
<p>Cash is money that is not tracked (except for transfers to and from other levels). Cash can be spent on anything, it is the grease that keeps everything running smoothly. Cash is self-limiting, if I am spending enough of it to make it worth tracking, then I am getting it from somewhere, and that somewhere must be an account under Operations, so it is tracked. This keeps the system reasonable to operate and reduces time spent tracking unimportant spending. Note that Cash does have to only mean paper money, for example, a gift card that you get as a credit card reward could go in this&nbsp;category.</p>
<p><span class="caps">IMAGE</span>: Operations inputs, internals, and&nbsp;outputs</p>
<p>Operations are the foundational accounts that regulate regular earning and spending. For example, a single checking account that keeps a couple months of expenses and is the main entry point for money (for example, direct deposit from jobs and payout from companies) combined with a high-yield savings account with six to twelve months of living and lifestyle expenses comprise the ideal Operations category. The savings account is also how I make payments. Ideally, income is regularly exceeding expenses, so the savings account fills up and serves as the emergency&nbsp;fund.</p>
<p><span class="caps">IMAGE</span>: Funds inputs and&nbsp;outputs</p>
<p>Funds are long-term savings accounts for a particular goal. A single high-yield savings account is an excellent vehicle to begin the Funds category. Funds are for funding things, from new investments and projects to big-ticket purchases. It makes &#8220;can I afford to do X&#8221; an easy question to answer: if there is enough money in Funds you can, if not, you&nbsp;can&#8217;t. </p>
<p><span class="caps">IMAGE</span>: Wealth inputs, internals, and&nbsp;outputs</p>
<p>Wealth is the final and most important category. While building wealth, money never leaves accounts in this category except in true emergencies. Policies around wealth can be revisited once these accounts generate nontrivial investment income or are of sufficient size for purchases like real estate. Until then, only add to and invest from Wealth&nbsp;accounts.</p>
<p>Examples&nbsp;(contrived):</p>
<p>Emily is an&nbsp;independent</p>
<p>Paul is a developer at&nbsp;a </p>
<p>Example&nbsp;(me):</p>
<p>I use quickbooks as an accounting&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Cash:&nbsp;Cash</p>
<p>Operations:</p>
<p>Checking</p>
<ul>
<li>Income<ul>
<li>work</li>
<li>contracts&nbsp;(business)</li>
<li>project income (projected/future)&nbsp;(business)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expenses<ul>
<li>Credit card&nbsp;(living)</li>
<li>tuition</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Savings: money through when I&nbsp;graduate</p>
<p>Funds: most of my savings for future equipment purchases and project starting&nbsp;capital</p>
<p>Wealth: small fraction of my savings invested in stocks. As I get older and get more income and projects either fail or become self-sustaining, more income goes into Wealth, and sucessful projects contribute back into&nbsp;funds. </p>
<p>How does Business factor into&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>Taxes, especially around funds and operations. Small businesses basically only have funds and operations: all spending should be tracked, so there is no Cash, and any money that would be saved as Wealth in a perosnal system is paid as a dividend to you, where it can support your living, increase your net worth, or fund unrelated&nbsp;projects. </p>
<p>Cash Flow vs <span class="caps">PL</span></p>
<p>This system is not right to apply to certain things that haven&#8217;t come up for me yet (links to systems that&nbsp;do):</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying&nbsp;debts</li>
</ul>
